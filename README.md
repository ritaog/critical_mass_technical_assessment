# FRONTEND DEVELOPER TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT

## WORK / PROJECT EXAMPLES

** Provide up to three examples of work/projects that youâ€™ve recently participated in and provide detailed information about your role and contributions to the project. **

### 1. PolyPay App

    A market-place application for independent creators to market their wares on Instagram by posting their store-front link from the PolyPay app to their Instagram page, in order to redirect their followers back to their store on the app. Vendors can also schedule posts to Instagram, as well as manage their Instagram accounts within the app.

    My contributions include:
    -building reusable frontend components
    -integrating the Stripe API as a payment gateway, and using webhooks to retrieve data from Stripe.

## INSPIRATION

** Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring. **

### 1. Black Jack

    A card game that mimicks the Black Jack played in casinos.

    I am inspired by:
    - how much it was made to look exactly like the real-life game. Just like in casions, he used 6 decks, which must have been really difficult to implement.
    - The logic of assigning different card values, and figuring out what the cards were (he used numbers from 1-52), and for the users to know what cards are in their hands at any given time, as well as avoiding picking the same card twice in a hand.

Source code can be found here:

### 2. Band Name Generator

    Sometimes, people have a hard time comiing up with names. This app helps to generate unique band names

    I am inspired by:
    - the work that went into the design
    - the simplicity of the app, even though it is very useful and has real-life use cases.

## FOCUS

** If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your first 6 months at CM, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time. **

    With the help of my potential career developer at Critical Mass, I would do a skill map of my skill level and the technology stack I already know, and compare that to what is currently being used at Critical Mass, and then work towards filling in the skill gap.

    Also, I would love to improve my skill on making cool animations, and learn another frontend framework (Vue.js)

    Finally, I found the "Tap to Fly" game Critical Mass created for ASICS  to gamify their Instagram stories really remarkable, and if the opportunity arises, I would love to work on projects that involve some Social Media integrations, because I have previously worked on an App for small business owners to be able to schedule  posts to Instagram, and I enjoyed working on the App.
